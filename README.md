# Band Tracker

This is an app to let you put in some of the bands you've seen, put in some of the venues said band has been to, and to associate them based on what shows they've played. This app uses three tables, including one join table for a many-to-many relationship.

## Instructions

The app's tables' values are as follows when ran in ActiveRecord (along with all added intrinsic values that come along with ActiveRecord):

bands: band_name
venues: venue_name
bands_venues: band_id , venue_id
